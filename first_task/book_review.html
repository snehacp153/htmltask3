                <p>The story is about a Shepherd boy from Spain whose name is Santiago. He keeps getting the same dream about treasures that are lying in the Pyramids of Egypt. He embarks on a journey to follow his dream after meeting an old king who offers him magic stones and advice. Santiago crosses the Mediterranean and Sahara to find his treasures in Egypt and also accomplish his personal legend which is his purpose in life. The book details his journey and the various encounters that he experiences when following his dream. Throughout the journey, Santiago meets many new people and a lot of difficulty which ultimately helps him to learn and grow the entire way.
                    The boy’s subsequent search for hidden treasure takes him across country borders and brings him into contact with both the deceitful and most noble of humanity. He learns the value of persistence and hard work, the value of humility and the value of honour and bravery. Particularly touching is Santiago’s interaction with a crystal merchant who was hesitant to follow his dreams for fear of succeeding. The young boy’s courage in seizing opportunities and overcoming adversity inspired all those he came into contact with.
